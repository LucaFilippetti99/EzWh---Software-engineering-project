# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |   12             |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |  500                          | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 6000 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |  600   person hours            |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 18000 euros | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |    6000/(8*4*5)=  112 days             |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size | 600 person hours |112 days|
| estimate by product decomposition | 560 person hours|  days|
