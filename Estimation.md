# Project Estimation

# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |   25                  |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |  2000                          | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 50'000 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |  5000   person hours            |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 150'000 euros | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |    5'000/(8*4*5)=  31 days             |               
# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|requirement document    | 600 |
| GUI prototype | 300|
|design document | 700 |
|code |700|
| unit tests |500|
| api tests |700|
| management documents  |300|

# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size | 5000 person hours |31 weeks|
| estimate by product decomposition | 3800 person hours|24 weeks|
