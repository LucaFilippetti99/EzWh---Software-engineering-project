# Informal description
Medium companies and retailers need a simple application to manage the relationship with suppliers and the inventory of physical items stocked in a physical warehouse. 
The warehouse is supervised by a manager, who supervises the availability of items. When a certain item is in short supply, the manager issues an order to a supplier. In general the same item can be purchased by many suppliers. The warehouse keeps a list of possible suppliers per item. 

After some time the items ordered to a supplier are received. The items must be quality checked and stored in specific positions in the warehouse. The quality check is performed by specific roles (quality office), who apply specific tests for item (different items are tested differently). Possibly the tests are not made at all, or made randomly on some of the items received. If an item does not pass a quality test it may be rejected and sent back to the supplier. 

Storage of items in the warehouse must take into account the availability of physical space in the warehouse. Further the position of items must be traced to guide later recollection of them.

The warehouse is part of a company. Other organizational units (OU) of the company may ask for items in the warehouse. This is implemented via internal orders, received by the warehouse. Upon reception of an internal order the warehouse must collect the requested item(s), prepare them and deliver them to a pick up area. When the item is collected by the other OU the internal order is completed. 

EZWH (EaSy WareHouse) is a software application to support the management of a warehouse.

# Stories and personas

|	Actor	|Story|
| :-: | :-: |
|Warehouse Manager| Michael is 42 and work as a manager for a medium company. He is bordened of work and every day he has to face different problems. Because of his huge responsibilities he sometimes can’t sleep at night. But after his company started using the Easy Warehouse software Michael had time back for himself.	|
|Warehouse Worker |	Darryl is 40 years old and works as the move-that-heavy-box-over-there guy at a warehouse.
He hates this job. His back aches more and more each day and it pays little to nothing, but he has to put food on the table for his two kids and that's the only thing that keeps him going. 
Recently his boss, Michael, introduced some sort of software to manage the warehouse, which is nice. 
Now Darryl bippity-boppities his boxes with that laser-pistol-smartphone thingy and the system automatically keeps track of them.
He's happier now as he doesn't need to report and see Michael's face that often, and if he screws something up, he can always blame it on the software.|
|Supplier | Dwight is 43 years old and is a salesman at Dunder Mifflin Inc., a paper and packaging supply company. He is a hard worker but he could do much more if only the sales process wasn't so slow and time consuming. He wastes hours and hours on the phone to agree on orders with his customers and for any changes he is forced to call customers again to communicate the changes. But since his customers started using the EZWH software, he conveniently receives supply orders by email and with just one click sends the order directly to the warehouse.  |
|Quality Tester| Creed is 48 and works in the quality office of a warehouse. He loves this work and he is really involved in this. He is responsible in verifying that items received by the warehouse achieve strict quality parameter. Creed is really accurate and careful in this job and spends almost all of his attention to check each single item with different instruments. For this reason he is not interested in waste a lot of time in directly update on the pc specific test failures and acceptance of each item. When he has the result of quality tests, he wants to quickly report these in order to make warehouse workers able to physically manage items just checked.	|
